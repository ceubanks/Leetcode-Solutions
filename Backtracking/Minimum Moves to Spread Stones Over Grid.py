'''
Given a 2D grid of integers of size (3Ã—3), 
where each value represents the number of stones in the given cell, 
return the minimum number of moves required to place exactly one stone in each grid cell.

Constraints:

Only one stone can be moved in one move.

Stone from a cell can only be moved to another cell if they are adjacent (share a side).

The sum of all stones in the grid must be equal to 
9
.

grid.length = 3, grid[i].length = 3
'''

'''
3 0 1
0 2 2
0 0 1

output: 6

Extra stone locations:
[
(0,0), 3)
(1,1), 2)
(1,2), 2)
]

Zero stone locations:
[(0,1), (2,0), (2,1), (2,2)]

(0,0) has 3 stones, so we can move 1 stone to (0,1) and remove (0,1) from zero stone locations
(0,0) has 2 stones, so we can move 1 stone to (0,1) 
(1,1) has 2 stones, so we can move 1 stone to 

(1,1) has 2 stones, so we can move 1 stone to (2,0)
(1,2) has 2 stones, so we can move 1 stone to (2,1)

Now we have:
[(0,0), 1)
(1,1), 1)
(1,2), 1)

'''
1. Check if sum of all stones is 9
2. Find extra stones locations and zero stones locations
3. Backtrack to find the minimum moves.
    a. If we have extra stones, we can move them to zero stones locations.
    b. If we have multiple extra stones, we can move them to the same zero stone location.
    c. We can move one stone at a time to a zero stone location.
